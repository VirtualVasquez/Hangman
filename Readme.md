# Hangman in the Key of C#

A C# console-based version of the game Hangman. Ironically, it is not focused on musical terminology.

## How to Play

Instructions on how to play are provided in the console app, but the user can skip them at the beginning if they just want to go straight into the game.

If you want to try the game for yourself without needing an integrated development environment (IDE), you can find run the `.exe` file in this repository at `Battleship\bin\Debug\net5.0\Battleship.exe`.

## Summary

It's been about a year since I've last touched anything involving C#. While it's not the hardest thing to get back into, there are some key differences between C# and JavaScript that I needed to be more familiarized with. This project was just the right thing to help get back up to speed, as I've done a hangman project in react before. I was able to focus more on how C# works and how to work with it, and not fixate as much on the deliverables of any given app.
